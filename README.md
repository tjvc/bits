# Bits

A work-in-progress TypeScript BitTorrent client, written for educational purposes. It is intended to satisfy the [BitTorrent Protocol Specification](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html).

Writing a BitTorrent client is interesting because it teaches (amongst other things):

* Working with data at the level of bits, bytes and buffers
* TCP, including working with a simple protocol
* Concurrency
